### Case study:
This is one of my best react project till now. I tried to keep it as simple as possible. I have to explored sort() method in depth while building this app. Specificly I have to sort an array of objects (bookList) by rating, page-amount etc. So, In my compare func, I have built custom logic to sort correctly based on the criteria.
